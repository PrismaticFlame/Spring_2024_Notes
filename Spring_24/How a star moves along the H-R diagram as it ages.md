- The beginning of the star formation, where stars are just appearing on the main sequence
- Super massive stars start to die off and turn off the main sequence
- More massive stars start to turn off the main sequence
- More stars are in the red giant phase as they die off
![[star_cluster_age.png]]

- The main sequence turn-off tells us the age of the star cluster
	- The lower the turn off, the older the star cluster
- Bigger stars have already left the main seqeunce while the smaller longer lasting satrs are still stable

# Open Star Cluster
- Tens of thousandsa of stars
- A few parsecs across
- The Pleiades (Seven sisters) to right
- Less than 20 million years (from O-type stars)

Young cluster ~ 600 million years old

Old Cluster ~ 12 billions years old
