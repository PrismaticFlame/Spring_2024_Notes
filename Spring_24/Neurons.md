In the context of neural networks, neurons are fundamental computational units that mimic the functionality of biological neurons in the human brain. Neurons process information by receiving input signals, performing computations, and generating output signals. In artificial neural networks, neurons serve as building blocks that process and transmit information throughout the network.

### Structure of Neurons:

A typical artificial neuron consists of the following components:

1. **Input Signals (Features):**
   - Neurons receive input signals from other neurons or directly from the input data. These input signals represent the features of the data being processed.

2. **Weights (Parameters):**
   - Each input signal is associated with a weight, which determines the strength of the connection between the input signal and the neuron. These weights are adjustable parameters that the neural network learns during training.

3. **Summation Function:**
   - The neuron computes a weighted sum of its input signals and weights. This weighted sum represents the total input to the neuron, taking into account the importance of each input signal determined by its associated weight.

4. **[[Activation Function]]:**
   - The weighted sum of inputs is then passed through an activation function, also known as a transfer function. The activation function introduces non-linearity to the neuron's output, allowing neural networks to model complex relationships in the data.

5. **Output Signal:**
   - The output signal of the neuron, also known as the activation or response, is the result of applying the activation function to the weighted sum of inputs. It represents the neuron's response to the input signals and is propagated to other neurons in the network as input.

### Activation Functions:

Common activation functions used in neural networks include:

- **[[Sigmoid Function]]:** Sigmoid activation function squashes the input values between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Function:** Similar to the sigmoid function, but squashes input values between -1 and 1, providing a stronger gradient for optimization.
- **Rectified Linear Unit ([[ReLU]]):** ReLU activation function outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. ReLU is widely used in deep learning models due to its simplicity and effectiveness in training.

### Role in Neural Networks:

Neurons are organized in layers within neural networks, with each layer consisting of multiple neurons connected to neurons in adjacent layers. Input neurons receive input data, hidden neurons process and transform the data, and output neurons produce the final predictions or classifications. Through training, neural networks learn to adjust the weights of connections between neurons to minimize prediction errors and improve performance on a given task.
