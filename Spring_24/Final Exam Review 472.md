# In Class
## Exam Notes
- 3D transforms
	- Must set up 4x4 homogenous matrics IN PROPER ORDER
	- Can specify rotation portion as a composition of simpler transforms
- A*
	- A* on a simple grid
	- Know difference between Manhattan distance Eucliden distance
- PID equations - know what each term is, and relative impacts
- Differential drive kinematics
- Some vision
	- Filters/convloution kernels, projection, disparity calcs
- Did I mention that you'll need to be able to set up 3D transforms!
## Robot Model
- Send out a description of system
- You will have X days to clarify the set up of the relevant coordinate frames with me
	- I'll allow discussion of clarifying questions
	- Do NOT share final transforms
	- You MAY ask me (dr conner) questions
		- Won't confirm correctness
