In the context of neural networks, the sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, serves as an activation function that introduces non-linearity to the output of a neuron or a layer of neurons. Activation functions are crucial in neural networks as they determine whether a neuron should be activated (fired) or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs.

### Role of Sigmoid Function in Neural Networks:

1. **Non-linearity:** The sigmoid function is non-linear, which enables neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. Without non-linear activation functions like the sigmoid, neural networks would behave like a linear model, unable to capture complex patterns in the data.

2. **Output Scaling:** The sigmoid function maps the output of a neuron to a value between 0 and 1. This is particularly useful in binary classification tasks, where the output of the network represents the probability of belonging to one class (e.g., class 1) versus the other class (e.g., class 0). The sigmoid function ensures that the output is interpretable as a probability.

3. **Differentiability:** The sigmoid function is differentiable everywhere, which is essential for training neural networks using backpropagation, an algorithm that requires the computation of gradients with respect to the network's parameters. The smoothness of the sigmoid function allows for efficient optimization using gradient-based methods.

### Mathematical Formulation:

The sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ is defined as:

$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$

Here:
- $x$ is the input to the function,
- $e$ is Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.71828.

### Activation in Neural Networks:

In a neural network, the sigmoid function is typically applied element-wise to the output of each neuron in a layer. If \( z \) represents the weighted sum of inputs to a neuron (including bias), then the output \( a \) of the neuron after applying the sigmoid activation function is:

$a = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$

The output \( a \) represents the activation level of the neuron, indicating how strongly it should fire (activate) in response to its inputs.

### Limitations:

While the sigmoid function was widely used in earlier neural network architectures, it has some limitations, particularly in deep neural networks:
- **Vanishing Gradients:** Sigmoid functions can lead to vanishing gradients, especially in deep networks, where gradients become very small during backpropagation, making training slow and convergence difficult.
- **Saturating Neurons:** Sigmoid functions saturate at the extremes (near 0 and 1), leading to slow learning when gradients are close to zero.

Because of these limitations, alternative activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants are often preferred in modern neural network architectures.
