Shortest Job First (SJF) is a scheduling algorithm used in operating systems to prioritize the execution of processes based on their expected total run time or burst time. The key idea behind SJF scheduling is to select the process that has the shortest estimated duration to complete, with the goal of minimizing the average turnaround time. SJF can be preemptive or non-preemptive, depending on whether a running process can be interrupted to allow another process with a shorter burst time to execute.

### Non-Preemptive SJF:

1. **Arrival of Processes:**
   - Processes arrive at the ready queue.
  
2. **Selection Criteria:**
   - The process with the shortest burst time is selected for execution.

3. **Execution:**
   - The selected process is allowed to run until it completes its execution.

4. **Completion:**
   - After completion, the next process with the shortest burst time in the ready queue is selected.

5. **Repeat:**
   - Steps 3-4 are repeated until all processes have been executed.

### Preemptive SJF:

1. **Arrival of Processes:**
   - Processes arrive at the ready queue.

2. **Selection Criteria:**
   - The process with the shortest remaining burst time is selected for execution.

3. **Execution:**
   - The selected process is allowed to run for a predefined time slice (time quantum) or until it completes its execution, whichever comes first.

4. **Arrival of New Process:**
   - If a new process arrives or if the remaining burst time of another process becomes shorter, the scheduler reevaluates and may preempt the currently running process.

5. **Repeat:**
   - Steps 2-4 are repeated until all processes have been executed.

### Advantages of SJF:

- **Optimal Average Turnaround Time:**
  - SJF scheduling aims to minimize the average turnaround time, making it an optimal choice when burst times are accurately known.

- **Efficient Use of CPU:**
  - Shorter jobs are prioritized, leading to efficient CPU utilization.

### Disadvantages of SJF:

- **Prediction Challenges:**
  - Accurately predicting the burst time of a process can be challenging.

- **Starvation:**
  - Longer processes may face starvation if shorter processes keep arriving.

- **[[Convoy Effect]]:**
  - In non-preemptive SJF, a long process holding the CPU may prevent shorter processes from executing.

### Example:

Consider the following processes with their burst times:

| Process | Burst Time |
|---------|------------|
| P1      | 6          |
| P2      | 8          |
| P3      | 7          |
| P4      | 3          |

For non-preemptive SJF, the processes would be scheduled as follows:

1. Execute P4 (Burst Time: 3)
2. Execute P1 (Burst Time: 6)
3. Execute P3 (Burst Time: 7)
4. Execute P2 (Burst Time: 8)

In preemptive SJF, the scheduling may involve interleaved execution based on remaining burst times.

Shortest Job First is effective when burst times are accurately predicted, leading to optimal performance. However, predicting burst times precisely is often challenging in real-world scenarios.
