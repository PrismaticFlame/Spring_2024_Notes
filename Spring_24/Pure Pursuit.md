Pure Pursuit is a path-following algorithm commonly used in robotics and autonomous vehicles to navigate a mobile robot or vehicle along a predefined path. The idea behind Pure Pursuit is to determine the steering angle of the vehicle in such a way that it aims to track a point (called the pursuit point) on the path.

### Key Concepts of Pure Pursuit:

1. **Pursuit Point:**
   - The pursuit point is a point on the path that the vehicle is trying to reach. It is typically located at a certain lookahead distance along the path, meaning the vehicle looks ahead to determine its future position.

2. **Lookahead Distance:**
   - The lookahead distance is the distance ahead of the vehicle along the path where the pursuit point is selected. It determines how far into the future the vehicle plans its trajectory.

3. **Path Representation:**
   - The path is often represented as a sequence of waypoints or as a smooth curve. Waypoints are discrete points along the desired path, while a smooth curve provides a continuous representation.

4. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - The Pure Pursuit algorithm involves the following steps:
     - Determine the lookahead point on the path based on the lookahead distance.
     - Calculate the steering angle required for the vehicle to reach the pursuit point.

5. **Steering Angle Calculation:**
   - The steering angle is typically determined by trigonometric calculations. One common approach is to calculate the angle between the current vehicle heading and the line connecting the vehicle to the pursuit point.

6. **Control Loop:**
   - Pure Pursuit is often implemented as a control loop, where the vehicle continuously adjusts its steering angle based on its current position and the pursuit point.

7. **Advantages:**
   - Simple Implementation: Pure Pursuit is relatively simple to implement and computationally efficient.
   - Smooth Trajectories: The algorithm naturally generates smooth trajectories as the vehicle follows the curvature of the path.

8. **Limitations:**
   - Limited in Complex Environments: Pure Pursuit may struggle in complex environments with sharp turns, obstacles, or rapidly changing paths.

### Algorithm Steps in More Detail:

1. **Identify the Lookahead Point:**
   - Determine the lookahead point on the path. This point is chosen based on the lookahead distance and represents where the vehicle aims to be in the future.

2. **Calculate Steering Angle:**
   - Compute the steering angle required for the vehicle to reach the lookahead point. This often involves geometric calculations based on the current position, heading, and the pursuit point.

3. **Adjust Vehicle State:**
   - Update the vehicle's state, including its position, orientation, and steering angle, based on the calculated values.

4. **Iterative Process:**
   - Repeat the process in an iterative manner as the vehicle progresses along the path, continuously updating its state and adjusting the steering angle.

Pure Pursuit is versatile and can be applied to various vehicles, including wheeled robots, cars, and other mobile platforms. While it works well in certain scenarios, it may require additional considerations or modifications for use in more challenging environments with complex paths or obstacles.
