In mathematics, specifically in topology, two objects are said to be homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other without tearing or gluing. More formally, let \( X \) and \( Y \) be topological spaces, and let \( f_0 \) and \( f_1 \) be continuous maps from \( X \) to \( Y \). If there exists a continuous map \( F: X \times [0, 1] \rightarrow Y \) such that:
1. \( F(x, 0) = f_0(x) \) for all \( x \) in \( X \) (i.e., \( F \) restricts to \( f_0 \) at time 0),
2. \( F(x, 1) = f_1(x) \) for all \( x \) in \( X \) (i.e., \( F \) restricts to \( f_1 \) at time 1),
3. \( F \) is continuous in both arguments \( x \) and \( t \),

then \( f_0 \) and \( f_1 \) are said to be homotopic, and we write \( f_0 \simeq f_1 \).

Intuitively, homotopy captures the idea of continuous deformation. For example, a circle and a point are homotopic because you can continuously shrink the circle into a point. Similarly, two continuous paths in a space are homotopic if one can be continuously transformed into the other while maintaining the endpoints fixed.

Homotopy is a fundamental concept in algebraic topology, where it plays a crucial role in defining homotopy groups, homotopy equivalence, and other topological invariants. It provides a powerful tool for studying the shape and structure of topological spaces and understanding their properties.
