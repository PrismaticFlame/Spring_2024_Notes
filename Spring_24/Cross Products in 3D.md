The cross product is a vector operation in three-dimensional space that produces a vector perpendicular to the plane formed by two input vectors. The result of the cross product is a vector that is orthogonal to both input vectors. The mathematical representation of the cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) is denoted by \(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}\).

### Mathematical Formulation:

Given two vectors \(\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ A_3 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} B_1 \\ B_2 \\ B_3 \end{bmatrix}\), the cross product \(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}\) is calculated as follows:

\[ \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} A_2B_3 - A_3B_2 \\ A_3B_1 - A_1B_3 \\ A_1B_2 - A_2B_1 \end{bmatrix} \]

### Example 1:

Let's consider two vectors \(\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}\). The cross product \(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}\) is calculated as follows:

\[ \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} (3 \times 4 - 1 \times (-1)) \\ (1 \times 1 - 2 \times 4) \\ (2 \times (-1) - 3 \times 1) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 13 \\ -7 \\ -7 \end{bmatrix} \]

### Example 2:

Consider two vectors \(\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{D} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}\). The cross product \(\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{D}\) is calculated as follows:

\[ \mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{D} = \begin{bmatrix} ((-2) \times (-4) - 1 \times 0) \\ (1 \times 2 - 3 \times (-4)) \\ (3 \times 0 - (-2) \times 2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 14 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} \]

In both examples, the resulting vectors obtained from the cross product are perpendicular to the planes formed by the respective pairs of input vectors. The direction of the resulting vector is determined by the right-hand rule.
