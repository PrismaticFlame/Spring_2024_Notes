1. Strong Nuclear: Holds protons and neutrons together to form the nucleus of an atom.
2. Weak Nuclear: Radioactive decay.
3. Electromagnetic: Holds electrons in an atom, creates electricity and magnetic fields (opposites attract, likes repel)
4. Gravity: Attractive force between anything with mass

# Gravity
An attractive field force that depends on the mass of two objects and the distance between them.
	Makes things orbit (more to be discussed later)
	Can bend light and spacetime!

# Inverse Square Law
As you move farther away from something, the force of gravity decreases exponentially!

# Weight (Gravitational Force) on Planets
Weight depends on:
- The mass of the planet
- Your mass
- The radius of the planet (distance from center of planet)

# Escape Velocity
Escape velocity is the speed at which an object (regardless of mass) needs to travel in order to escape the gravitational pull of a planet/star
- Earth = 11.2 km/s
- Moon = 2.4 km/s
- Jupiter = 59.5 km/s
- Sun = 617.5 km/s
- Blackhole > 3 x 10^5 km/s (speed of light?)
