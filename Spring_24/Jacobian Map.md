It seems there might be a misunderstanding or confusion regarding the term "Jacobian Maps." Typically, the Jacobian matrix is not referred to as a "Jacobian Map." However, it's possible that you may be referring to a broader concept that involves using the Jacobian matrix in various applications or mappings.

Let's clarify the terminology and provide information on how the Jacobian matrix is used in different contexts:

### Jacobian Matrix Recap:

The Jacobian matrix, denoted as \(J\), represents the partial derivatives of a vector-valued function with respect to its input variables. In the context of robotics, it relates joint velocities $(\dot{\theta})$ to end-effector velocities $(\dot{x}), (\dot{y}), (\dot{z})$.

$J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta_2} & \ldots & \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta_n} \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta_2} & \ldots & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta_n} \\ \frac{\partial z}{\partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial \theta_2} & \ldots & \frac{\partial z}{\partial \theta_n} \end{bmatrix}$

### Possible Interpretation:

If by "Jacobian Maps" you mean the use of the Jacobian matrix in various applications or mappings, here are a few contexts where the Jacobian matrix is commonly applied:

1. **Velocity Mapping:**
   - The Jacobian matrix maps joint velocities to end-effector velocities in differential kinematics.
   - $\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix} = J \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\theta}_1 \\ \dot{\theta}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \dot{\theta}_n \end{bmatrix}$

2. **Singularity Analysis:**
   - The Jacobian is used to analyze singularities in the robot's configuration, where the manipulability of the robot becomes limited.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Inverse kinematics problems involve solving for joint velocities given end-effector velocities.
   - $\begin{bmatrix} \dot{\theta}_1 \\ \dot{\theta}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \dot{\theta}_n \end{bmatrix} = J^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix}$

4. **Task-Space Control:**
   - In task-space control, the Jacobian is used to map desired end-effector velocities to joint velocities to achieve a specific task.

It's important to note that the term "Jacobian Maps" may not be a standardized term, and its interpretation could depend on the specific context in which it is used. If you have a particular context or application in mind, providing more details would help in providing a more accurate explanation.
