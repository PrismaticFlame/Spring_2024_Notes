# Terms
- **Parallax**
	- Because stars are so far away, the angles measured are very very small, so we measure them in arc seconds rather than degrees
	- Apparent shift of an object relative to some distant background, as the observer's point of view changes
- **Spectroscopic Parallax**
	- Measure the star's apparent brightness and spectral type to find the distance to the star
		- Use the spectral type to estimate star's luminosity, assuming main sequence
		- Apply the inverse square law to determine the distance of the star
- **Parsec**
	- If the parallax is 1" (1 arc second, 1/3600 degrees) then the object must be 206,265 AU ($3.1 x 10^6$m) or 1 parsec away from the Sun.
- **Apparent Brightness (magnitude)**
	- The amount of energy striking a unit area of some light sensitive surface (human eye or camera)
		- Location dependent
			- Will increase as you get closer to the surface
	- $B \propto L/d^2$ 
	- Large magnitude means a lower brightness
	- A change of 5 magnitude is **a factor of 100 apparent magnitude**
		- 1 is approximately 100 times brighter than 6
- **Luminosity**
	- The amount of radiation leaving a star per unit time
		- Independent of location or motion of observer
	- We can't measure stellar size for stars far away, so must get indirect determinations of the size of stars
	- Luminosity is related to both temperature and surface area
		- Larger stars radiate more than smaller stars
	- $L \propto r^2T^4$ or "Luminosity is proportional to radius squared times temperature to the fourth" so the higher the temperature and luminosity, the higher the radius of the star!
- **Dwarf stars**
	- Any star with a radius comparable to our Sun or smaller radius
	- Red dwarves
	- Brown dwarves
	- White dwarves
	- Black dwarves
- **Giant stars**
	- Giants: 10 - 100 times the radius of the Sun ($R_{\Phi}$) 
	- Super Giants: up to 1000 $R_{\Phi}$
	- 
- **Spectral Class**
	- Tells us the the stars surface temperature better then black body radiation
		- The star classifications of **O, B, A, F, G, K, M**
			- Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me (From greatest to least in terms of size).
		- Subdivisions are number 0-9
		- The lower the number the hotter the star.
			- A G1 is a little hotter than a G4
	- The main sequence star classifications. They are a similar size if they are a similar temperature
- **Luminosity Class**
	1. 0 *or* Ia$^+$ - hypergiants or extremely luminous supergiants
	2. Ia - luminous supergiants
	3. Iab - intermediate-size luminous supergiants
	4. Ib - less luminous supergiants
	5. II - bright giants
	6. III - normal giants
	7. IV - subgiants
	8. V - main-sequence stars (dwarfs)
	9. sd *or* VI - subdwarfs
	10. D *or* VII - white dwarfs
- **Cosmic Background Radiation**
	- leftover radiation from the Big Bang or the time when the universe began
	- Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) 1992
		- This is modelled picture of the universe when light separated at 0.38 Million Years after the big bang
		- The photons released are not uniform!
			- Instead, clustering happened
- **Standard candle**
	- Easily recognizable astronomical objects that whose luminosities are confidently known
		- Planetary nebulae
		- Type 1 supernova
	- We can then compare apparent brightness with luminosity and get distance
- **Hubble's Law**
	- The farther away an object is, the faster it is moving away from us!
- **Tully-Fisher relation**
	- relationship between rotation speeds and luminosities or spiral galaxies
		- Measure rotation speed, gives luminosity, compare this to apparent brightness... get distance
- **Variable Stars**
	- A star whose brightness (or other physical properties such as radius or spectral type) changes over time. i.e a pulsating star
	-  Pulsating stars:
		- Normal stars that are experiencing a brief period of instability as a natural part of stellar evolution
- **Types of galaxies**
	- Spiral: central bulge, a halo, a disk, and spiral arms
		- Younger satrs, very dusty, stars still forming
	- Elliptical: entirely old stars and have shapes that are spheres or ellipsoids
		- Have more older, redder stars
	- Irregular: lower masses and luminosities than spiral galaxies, disorganized
		- Intense star formation activity
		- Contain both young population stars and old population stars
- **Interstellar medium**
	- Dark spots in the sky make it look devoid of stars
		- These areas of space are NOT empty, but the starlight is blocked by interstellar gas and dust
	- Since longer wavelengths can pass more easily through the interstellar material, there is a "reddening" of the stars behind (or in) the cloud
	- Some clouds block all visible light, and stars can only be seen in the infrared
	- The average density of interstellar space is $10^6$ atoms per cubic meter
		- The best vacuums on Earth can only reach $10^9$ atoms per cubic meter
- **Reddening**
	- Spectrum seen due to the higher frequencies (blue and purple) of light scattering more than the lower frequencies (red)
	- 
- **Emission nebula**
	- Glow from stars within the nebula
- **Reflection nebulae** 
	- seen by light (usually blue) reflecting off of them
- **Molecular clouds**
	- Very dense ($10^{12}$ particles per cubic meter) very cold (20 K) clouds in space
		- Contain heavier molecules pulled together by gravity
		- Can be up to millions of times the mass of the sun
		- Can be found in very large complexes
			- 50 pc across
- **Protostar**
	- Size - Mercury's orbit (0.4 AU)
	- Central temp - 1,000,000 K (not enough for fusion)
	- Luminosity ~ 1000x the Sun (from relase of gravitational energy)
	- Can now be plotted on H-R diagram and starts an "evolutionary track" of the star
- **Evolutionary track**
	- How it moves across the H-R diagram (curve from bottom right to top left)
		- Formation
		- Main Sequence
		- Post-Main Sequence
			- Red Giant Phase
			- Horizontal Branch
			- Blue Supergiant Phase
		- Stellar Remnants
		- Variable Stars
	- Larger stars take a shorter time to form 
		- O-type ~ 1 million years (1/50 of the Sun's time)
	- Smaller stars take much longer
		- M-type ~ 1 billion years
- **Dust lanes**
	- Darker part of the cloud that obscure light
- **Brown Dwarf**
	- A star that starts the process but never becomes a true star due to the lack of mass to start fusion reactions
		- There could be as many as 100 billion brown dwarf's in interstellar space (comparable to the number of stars in our galaxy)
		- Minimum mass needed for Fusion: 0.08 M solar masses or 80 jupiter masses
- **Helium flash**
	- Once helium starts burning, the core can't respond quickly enough and there is an explosion that lasts a few hours
- **Nova**
	- A white dwarf can explode in activity and luminosity, becoming a nova
	- The white dwarf star can siphon off mass from the main sequence star counterpart and reignite
		- Mass accumulates on the white dwarf, the temperature will rise & hydrogen fusion will ignite
	- This surface burning stage is brief and violent (nova)
- **Supernova (Type 1 and Type 2)**
	- Types of supernova as seen by their spectra and their luminosity
		- Type 1 supernova:
			- very little hydrogen, light curve similar to that of a nova
			- In  white dwarves, the electrons are touching, which creates pressure
				- There is a limit to how much mass there can be around the star before the pressure exceeds what the electrons can hold.
					- Chandrasekhar mass = 1.4 Solar Masses
			- When this mass is exceeded, the core starts to fuse carbon all at once. This causes the star to explode in a carbon-detonation supernova
		- Type 2 supernova
			- hydrogen rich, plateau for a few months
			- Core-collapse supernova
				- Happens during death of massive stars
			- The leftover core is now a neutron star
- **Planetary Nebula**
	- The stars non-burning envelope is now expanding and will be lost in less than 1 million years
	- There are now 2 parts of the star
		- The core - very hot and very luminous
		- A cloud of cool gas and dust surrounding the core
	- As the core heats up, it produces UV radiation that ionizes the cloud and creates a beautiful planetary nebula
- **White dwarf (black dwarf)**
	- the leftover core of the star
		- About the size of Earth
		- Mass 0.5 Solar Masses
		- Shines by left over heat NOT nuclear fusion
		- May or may not be seen with a planetary nebula depending on age
		- Will burn out and become a black dwarf (stage 14) or a dead star
- **Neutron star**
	- What is left after a type 2 core-collapse supernova
		- The core is compressed neutrons
		- Very small (20km) but with large mass (more mass than our Sun, but no more than 3 Solar Masses).... very large densities
		- Rotate rapidly (periods of less than 1 second)
		- Have some of the strongest magnetic fields in the universe
- **Pulsar**
	- Rapid pulses in radio radiation
		- All pulsars are rotating neutron stars
		- The pulsar has to be in the right orientation for us to detect the pulse
		- Incredibly precise pulses
			- Better than any of our clocks
- **Black hole**
	- Above 3 Solar Masses, the neutrons in a neutron star can not withstand the force of gravity
		- If a large enough core is left after a supernova, the core can collapse to a point thus causing a *black hole*
		- Original star is most likely Mass > 25 Solar Masses
	- **Quasars**
	- The jets of radiation and particles that are given off by active galaxies from their black holes
		- Very old
		- Very luminous
			- 20 trillion suns or 1000 milky ways
		- Closest one is 240 Mpc
		- Farthest one is 9000 Mpc
	- Lobes can span 1 million light years
	- Particles are accelerated along the strong magnetic field as close to the speed of light
		- This gives off very strong radiation
		- The amount of energy given off depends on the amount of material consumed
- **Event horizon (Schwarzchild radius)**
	- Schwarzchild radius - the radius for a given mass, where the escape velocity become equal to the speed of light
		- For Earth it's about 1 cm
	- The Schwarzchild radius is that distance at which no event be ever be detected. This is called the Event Horizon
		- The event horizon is not a phyiscal boundary but a *communication barrier*
- **Star Clusters**
	- When a nebular cloud collapses and starts forming stars, *many stars are formed at once.*
		- All the stars in a cluster are formed under the same conditions at the same time (same age).
		- Therefore, the only difference between the star is mass

# Concepts to Know
- **How we measure the distance of a star**
	- Parallax & Spectroscopic Parallax
- **Parallax**
	- Closer objects move more than distant objects
	- Easiest way to do this is to take photos of stars at different times of the year
	- Can only work for stars at certain distances away
	- Distance (parsec) = 1 / parallax (arc seconds)
- **Spectroscopic Parallax**
	- Use the spectral type to estimate star's luminosity, assuming main sequence
	- Apply the inverse square law to determine the distance of the star
- **H-R Diagram**
	- The *Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram*: Astronomers started to plot the known stars based on surface temperature (spectral class) and luminosity and found something interesting. A pattern developed for the position of the stars on plot and thus helped our knowledge of the types of stars and their lifespan
	- Different sections describe different types of stars
		- Main Sequence
		- White dwarfs
		- Giants
		- Supergiants
		- Red dwarfs
- **Main sequence stars**
	- The section of the H-R diagram that includes the most amount of stars in a slightly upwards curving line in the middle of the graph
		- Our sun is in this section
- **Binary systems**
	- Star systems mostly occur in binaries
		- 2 stars that orbit about their common center of mass
		- Our lonely single star is actually not as common
	- Ways we know of binary stars
		- Visual binary: A star system that is known to have two stars due to the two stars actually being able to be seen revolving around one another (only seen if very near)
		- Spectroscopic binary: A binary star system found due to the effects of the doppler effect as seen in the spectra of the star ( Noticeable changes in the spectra of the light coming from the star seen redshifted at a particular time and then blue shifted at another time)
		- Eclipsing binary: A binary star system found due to the apparent brightness drop for a star
			- Brightness drops significantly more than the potential for an exoplanet, due to the size difference between the binary stars
			- Also decreases brightness when one star is behind the other
- **Classification of stars and what they tell us about the stars**
	- Tells us the surface temperature better than black body radiation 
- **Spectral class (OBAFGKM)**
	1. O
	2. B
	3. A
	4. F
	5. G
	6. K
	7. M
- **Magnitude class (-30 to 30)**
	- The lower the number, the brighter the objects appear, and the higher the number the dimmer the number
- **Luminosity class**
	1. 0 *or* Ia$^+$ - hypergiants or extremely luminous supergiants
	2. Ia - luminous supergiants
	3. Iab - intermediate-size luminous supergiants
	4. Ib - less luminous supergiants
	5. II - bright giants
	6. III - normal giants
	7. IV - subgiants
	8. V - main-sequence stars (dwarfs)
	9. sd *or* VI - subdwarfs
	10. D *or* VII - white dwarfs
- **Different types of nebulae**
	- A cloud of interstellar dust and gas
		- Emission nebulae - glow from stars within the nebula
		- Dust lanes - darker part of the cloud that obscure light
		- Reflection nebulae - seen by light (usually blue) reflecting off of them
		- Dark dust cloud (dark nebulae) - cooler and more dense than most interstellar clouds
- **How we measure nebulae**
	- Notice the difference between emission nebula, reflection nebula, and dust lanes
	- Nebula "fuzziness": The fuzziness around the edge of the dust lanes is due to the radiation from the stars dispersing the clouds
- **The steps to forming a star like our sun**
	1. Interstellar Cloud
		- Dark dust cloud or molecular cloud
		- Density: $10^9$ particles per cubic meter
		- Temperature - ~10k
		- Size - Tens of parsecs
		- Time - a few million years
		- Collapse into smaller fragments - each fragment may become a star (lots of little stars or a few big stars)
	2. Contracting Cloud
		- Size - 10,000x our Sun
		- Shape - sphereical
		- Central temp - 10,000 K
			- radiation that can't escape heats up the cloud
		- Central density - $10^{18}$ particles per cubic meter ($10^{-9}$ kg/m$^3$)
		- Enough mass accumulated to create a protostar w/ photosphere
	3. Protostellar Evolution - Big and Bright
		- Size - 10x our Sun
		- Luminosity - 10x solar luminosity
		- Surface temp - 4000 K
		- Central temp - 5,000,000 K
			- no fusion, yet!
		- Gas is totally ionized (plasma)
	4. T-Tauri Phase
		- Lots of surface activity creates very strong protostellar winds
		- Interaction with the winds and the nebular disk often results in bipolar flow - 2 jets
		- Hydrogen starts to fuse!
			- A star is born
		- After this phase it is a star, but it's not a main sequence yet
	5. Main Sequence Adult Life
		- The star contracts for about 30 million years after hydrogen fusion begins
			- Hydrostatic Equilibrium
			- Central density - $10^{32}$ particles per meter cubed
			- Central temp - 15 million K
			- Surface temp - 6000 K
			- Has taken 40-50 million years to get here
				- Will stay here ~ 10 billion years
	- Other, concise way of looking at star formation:
		1. Dark cloud
		2. Gravitational collapse
		3. Protostar
		4. T-Tauri star
		5. Pre-main sequence star
		6. Young stellar system
- **How stars move along the H-R diagram as they form**
	- Larger stars take a shorter time to form
		- O-type ~ 1 million years (1/50 of the Sun's time)
	- Smaller stars take much longer
		- M-type ~ 1 billion years
	- Stars spend >90% of their life on the main sequence
- **Different types of supernova**
	- Type 1 Supernova
		- In white dwarves, the electrons are touching, which creates pressure
			- There is a limit to how much mass there can be around the star before the pressure exceeds what the electrons can hold
		- When this mass is exceeded, the core starts fuse carbon all at once. This causes the star to explode in a carbon-detonation supernova
	- Type II supernova
		- Core-collapse supernova
			- Happens during the death of massive stars
		- The leftover core is now a neutron star
	- Supernova Wikipedia
		- Type Ia
		- Type Ib/c
		- Type II-P/-L/n
		- Type IIb
		- Type III
		- Type IV
		- Type V
- **Death of low mass vs. high mass star**
	- Death of low mass star
		- Ash core builds up
		- As ash core shrinks, the star expands as gravitational energy is released
		- "Burning" shells heat up
		- If temperatures are hot enough the ash core starts to "burn"
	- Death of Massive stars
		- Stars of 4-10 Solar Masses
			- *No helium flash*
			- 4 M Solar Masses: ends after fusing carbon and becomes a **carbon-oxygen white dwarf**
			- 10 M Solar Masses: depends on the amount of mass lost in the evolution process
	- Death of Really Big Stars > 10 Solar Masses
		- Larger stars fuse with a different fusion cycle (CNO)
			- They burn through their "fuel" faster
			- Start to fuse Helium before leaving main sequence
			- High stellar winds can carry off as much as 10% of the star's original mass
		- A period of instability is associated with the fusing of each new element (changes in radius and temp but very little change in luminosity)
			- Fusion stops at Iron
- **How we use star clusters to tell us about stellar evolution**
	- Star clusters show us pictures of stars in each stage of evolution
	- In star clusters:
		- All stars are born at the same time
		- They evovle at different rates
	- We can then use the H-R diagram to tell approximate age of cluster
- **[[How a star moves along the H-R diagram as it ages]]**
- **How heavier elements are formed**
	- Some can be made in the red giant phase
		- With other elements fusing together
	- Many are created during the supernova explosion itself
- **The life cycle of stars, why do younger stars have heavier elements**
	- Because each cycle puts heavier elements into the interstellar medium, younger stars have more detectable heavy elements than older stars
	- With each cycle, the stars will change and evolve as hydrogen is turned into helium and heavier elements 
- **Why the luminosity, temperature and radius change during the process of becoming a white dwarf**
	- Main sequence phase: Fusing hydrogen to helium, star starts here and remains here for most of its life and is stable in terms of those componenets
	- Red Giant Phase: Exhausting the hydrogen in core, it undergoes expansion and becomes a red giant. During this phase, the luminosity increases significantly while its surface temp decreases. Expansion leads to an increase in radius
	- Helium Fusion: The core eventually becomes hot and dense enough to initiate helium fusion, forming carbon and oxygen. This fusion process temporarily halts the collapse of the star, but eventually reactions cease and the core contracts further
	- Planetary Nebula: In the final stages of its life, the outer layers get expelled forming a planetary nebula. The core becomes a white dwarf, greatly dropping the luminosity of the star but greatly increases because of compression
- **How we "measure" black holes**
	- We canot directly measure a black hole (by definition)
	- Can measure:
		- Energy (X-rays) given off as it accumlates more mass (from nearby stars or at the center of galaxy)
		- The gravitational effects on other bodies
- **Cosmic red shift**
	- Cosmological Redshift is not due to the motion of distant galaxies, but due to the expansion of the universe
- **How we measure distances**
	- Since we know where pulsating variable stars lie on the H-R diagram we can infer their luminosity
		- Compare luminosity to apparent brightness and get distance
- **Need for Dark Energy and Dark Matter**
	- [Dark Matter]"stuff" that interacts gravitationally with matter but we cannot detect in any direct way
		- Called "dark" because we don't really understand what it is, i.e it's "invisible"
	- This not directly observed "stuff" is needed to explain the structure of the universe and the motions of stars within galaxies
	- [Dark Energy] the anti-gravitational force that is causing the universe to expand more rapidly
		- It is the energy and pressure associated with empty space!
		- Both Dark Matter (unseen, highly non-interactive stuff) and Dark Energy (the vacuum anti gravity) have an effect on the "shape" of spacetime
