In the context of machine learning, an epoch is a single pass through the entire training dataset during the training of a model. During each epoch, the model processes the entire dataset once, updating its parameters based on the observed data and the optimization algorithm. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that determines how many times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

### Key Points about Epochs:

1. **Training Iteration:**
   - An epoch consists of one full training iteration through the entire dataset.

2. **Multiple Epochs:**
   - It is common to train a model for multiple epochs to allow it to learn from the dataset more thoroughly.

3. **Convergence:**
   - The choice of the number of epochs depends on the convergence behavior of the model. Training might stop when performance on a validation set stops improving.

4. **Batch Size:**
   - The number of epochs is often considered in conjunction with the batch size. The total number of iterations (updates) is determined by the product of the number of epochs and the number of batches processed per epoch.

### Example:

Suppose you have a dataset with 1,000 samples, and you choose a batch size of 50. To complete one epoch, you would process 1,000 / 50 = 20 batches of data. If you train the model for 5 epochs, it would go through the entire dataset 5 times.

```python
# Example in Python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(1000, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(1000, 1)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Set hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.01
num_epochs = 5
batch_size = 50

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i in range(0, len(X_train), batch_size):
        X_mini_batch = X_train[i:i+batch_size]
        y_mini_batch = y_train[i:i+batch_size]
        
        model.fit(X_mini_batch, y_mini_batch)

    # Evaluate on validation set after each epoch
    y_val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    val_error = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_val_pred)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Validation Error: {val_error}")

print("Training complete.")
```

In this example, the model is trained for 5 epochs, where each epoch involves processing mini-batches of data. The performance on the validation set is evaluated after each epoch to monitor the learning progress.
