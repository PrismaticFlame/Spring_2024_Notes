Least Squares Estimation (LSE) is a method used in statistical modeling to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. The most common application of LSE is in linear regression, where the goal is to find the best-fitting line through a set of data points.

### Linear Regression Model:

In a simple linear regression model with one independent variable (\(x\)) and one dependent variable (\(y\)), the model is represented as:

$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$

Here:
- \(y\) is the dependent variable,
- \(x\) is the independent variable,
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept,
- \(\beta_1\) is the slope,
- \(\epsilon\) is the error term.

### Least Squares Objective:

The objective of least squares estimation is to find the values of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed (\(y_i\)) and predicted (\(\hat{y}_i\)) values for all data points:

$\text{Minimize:} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$

### Derivation of Least Squares Estimates:

1. **Define the Error Term:**
   - The error term (\(\epsilon_i\)) represents the difference between the observed and predicted values for each data point:
     $\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors:
     $\text{Minimize:} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_i^2$

3. **Express in Terms of Model Parameters:**
   - Substitute the expression for \(\hat{y}_i\) from the regression model:
     $\text{Minimize:} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i))^2$

4. **Partial Derivatives:**
   - Take partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\).

5. **Set Derivatives to Zero:**
   - Set the partial derivatives to zero and solve the resulting system of equations.

6. **Solve for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\):**
   - Solve the system of equations to obtain the least squares estimates \(\hat{\beta}_0\) and \(\hat{\beta}_1\).

### Least Squares Estimates:

The least squares estimates for the simple linear regression model are given by:

$\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

$\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$

Here:
- \(n\) is the number of observations,
- \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are the values of the independent and dependent variables,
- \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the sample means of the independent and dependent variables.

### Example:

Consider the following dataset with two variables (height and weight):

$\begin{align*} \text{Height (inches):} & [65, 68, 73, 71, 70]\\\text{Weight (lbs):} & [125, 140, 160, 150, 145]\end{align*}$

To find the least squares estimates for the simple linear regression model \(weight = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{height}\), the formulas for \(\hat{\beta}_0\) and \(\hat{\beta}_1\) would be used.

### Python Example (using NumPy):

```python
import numpy as np

# Given data
height = np.array([65, 68, 73, 71, 70])
weight = np.array([125, 140, 160, 150, 145])

# Calculate least squares estimates
mean_height = np.mean(height)
mean_weight = np.mean(weight)

beta_1 = np.sum((height - mean_height) * (weight - mean_weight)) / np.sum((height - mean_height)**2)
beta_0 = mean_weight - beta_1 * mean_height

print("Least Squares Estimate for beta_0:", beta_0)
print("Least Squares Estimate for beta_1:", beta_1)
```

In this example, the least squares estimates for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are calculated based on the provided height and weight data. These estimates define the best-fitting line through the data points in terms of a linear regression model.
