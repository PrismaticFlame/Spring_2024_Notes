Matrix multiplication is an operation that combines two matrices to produce a third matrix. The process involves multiplying the elements of one matrix by the elements of another matrix and summing the results according to specific rules. Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and has wide applications in various fields, including physics, computer graphics, and robotics.

Here are the steps for matrix multiplication, and I'll provide a few examples to illustrate:

### Matrix Multiplication Rules:

Given two matrices A and B, where A is an \(m \times n\) matrix (m rows, n columns) and B is an \(n \times p\) matrix (n rows, p columns), the resulting matrix C will be an \(m \times p\) matrix. The element at the ith row and jth column of C is calculated by multiplying the elements of the ith row of matrix A by the elements of the jth column of matrix B and summing the products.

**Matrix C (i, j) = \(\sum_{k=1}^{n} A(i, k) \times B(k, j)\)**

### Example:

Let's consider two matrices A and B:

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$

$B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$

### Calculation:

\[ C(1,1) = 1 \times 5 + 2 \times 7 = 19 \]

\[ C(1,2) = 1 \times 6 + 2 \times 8 = 22 \]

\[ C(2,1) = 3 \times 5 + 4 \times 7 = 31 \]

\[ C(2,2) = 3 \times 6 + 4 \times 8 = 38 \]

### Resultant Matrix:

\[ C = \begin{bmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 31 & 38 \end{bmatrix} \]

### Python Code for Matrix Multiplication:

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

C = np.dot(A, B)
print(C)
```

This Python code uses the NumPy library to perform matrix multiplication. The result is the same as the manual calculation:

```
[[19 22]
 [31 38]]
```

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental concept, and understanding it is crucial for various mathematical and computational applications. When multiplying matrices, it's essential to ensure that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix for the operation to be defined.
