Potential fields, also known as artificial potential fields or potential field methods, are a class of path planning algorithms used in robotics to navigate robots through environments while avoiding obstacles. These methods are based on the concept of simulating forces analogous to physical potentials to guide the robot towards its goal while repelling it from obstacles.

### Key Concepts of Potential Fields:

1. **Goal Attraction:**
   - The potential field creates an attractive force that pulls the robot towards the goal position. This force is strongest when the robot is far from the goal and diminishes as the robot gets closer.

2. **Obstacle Repulsion:**
   - Obstacles in the environment generate repulsive forces that push the robot away from them. The strength of the repulsive force increases as the robot gets closer to obstacles.

3. **Superposition of Forces:**
   - The total force acting on the robot is the superposition of the attractive force towards the goal and the repulsive forces from nearby obstacles. The robot moves in the direction of the resultant force.

4. **Potential Function:**
   - A potential function is defined over the entire workspace, representing the combination of attractive and repulsive potentials. The potential function is typically designed such that it has a minimum at the goal position and increases near obstacles.

5. **[[Gradient Descent]]:**
   - The robot navigates by performing gradient descent on the potential function. It moves in the direction opposite to the gradient of the potential function, thereby minimizing the potential energy.

6. **Local Minima Avoidance:**
   - Potential fields may suffer from local minima, where the robot gets stuck due to the interplay of attractive and repulsive forces. Various techniques, such as introducing randomness or adjusting parameters dynamically, can help the robot escape local minima.

### Advantages and Limitations:

- **Advantages:**
  - Conceptually simple and computationally efficient.
  - Can handle dynamic environments and moving obstacles.
  - Does not require a map of the environment, making it suitable for unknown or partially known environments.

- **Limitations:**
  - May converge to suboptimal paths due to local minima.
  - Prone to getting stuck in narrow passages or cluttered environments.
  - Can generate oscillatory or unstable behavior near obstacles.

### Variants of Potential Fields:

1. **Gradient-Based Methods:**
   - These methods compute the gradient of the potential function directly to determine the robot's direction of motion. Examples include artificial potential field methods and harmonic potential field methods.

2. **Vector Field Histograms (VFH):**
   - VFH methods discretize the environment into a grid and compute a polar histogram of obstacle densities around the robot. The robot selects a direction with the lowest obstacle density to navigate towards.

3. **[[Dynamic Potential Fields]]:**
   - Dynamic potential field methods adapt the potential function based on real-time sensor measurements and robot dynamics. They can handle moving obstacles and dynamic changes in the environment.

Potential fields have been widely used in mobile robotics, autonomous vehicles, and swarm robotics due to their simplicity and effectiveness in navigating robots through cluttered environments. However, their performance can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the environment and the tuning of parameters.
