The distance between two points on a Cartesian coordinate system can be calculated using the distance formula. Given two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), the distance \(d\) between them is given by the formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify the coordinates of the two points:**
   - Let the coordinates of the first point be \((x_1, y_1)\).
   - Let the coordinates of the second point be \((x_2, y_2)\).

2. **Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates:**
   - \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \)
   - \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 \)

3. **Square the differences:**
   - \( (\Delta x)^2 \) and \( (\Delta y)^2 \)

4. **Sum the squared differences:**
   - \( (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 \)

5. **Take the square root of the sum:**
   - \( \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2} \)

This gives you the Euclidean distance between the two points in the Cartesian coordinate system.

For example, if you have two points A(3, 4) and B(7, 1), the distance between them (\(d\)) would be:

\[ d = \sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]

So, the distance between A and B is 5 units.
