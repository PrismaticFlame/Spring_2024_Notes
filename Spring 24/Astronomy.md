Introductions:
1. Chris
2. He/him
3. Just recently got really into reading!
4. Want to learn about the stars
5. Love games

Exams:
Final exam is NOT cumulative.
Semester long project on sun spots.

# Sunspot Project
Due Date: Tuesday March 26th
Daily sunspot number from: www.spaceweather.com
Essentially, 3 times a week write down the number of sunspots from that website and it will be checked each Tuesday starting January 23rd.

# Astronomy 1
What is science?
- Science is a process
- Science is always changing
- Science does not have all the answers (well. not yet)
- In science, answering one question should create at least 2 new questions
- When new data is measured that doesn't fit the current understanding, either theories change or new theories come about.
	- Mostly old theories change in a very minor way that the majority of the public will never know.

## What is a scientific theory?
- The goal of science isn't to prove, but rather to support, disprove, and adjust.
- It is easy to disprove.
	- (1 experiment can disprove, but many repeatable experiments are needed to support)
- After an idea (hypothesis) is supported over and over and over, it becomes a scientific theory.

==Astronomy vs. Astrology==. Astronomy is not related Astrology.

Correlation does not mean causation. 

How big is the universe? Not said yet, but rather large.

Metric prefixes. (up to yotta)

## Smallest thing you know about? 

**Nucleus (center)**
- Particles
	- Proton (positive)
	- Neutrons (neutral) 
- Overall charge
	- Positive
- Mass
	- Holds almost all the mass of an atom
	- The mass depends on the number of protons plus neutrons
- Mass of p/n = 1.67 x 10^-27kg
**Electron Cloud/Energy levels (outer)**
- Particles
	- Electrons (negative) e-
- Overall charge
	- Negative
- Mass (electron)
	- Mass of electron is 1/1836 the mass of a proton and neutron

Using Bohr model of the atom right now.

Atoms and elements
- Are neutral unless they have lost or gained electrons
- The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus
- The atomic mass of an element is based on the number of protons and neutrons
**Ions**
- When an atom gains or loses electrons it becomes charged.
	- If an atom loses electrons it becomes positive
	- If an atom gains electrons it becomes negative.
- An ionized gas is called a plasma
	- A plasma is a gas that is so hot that the electrons have enough energy to escape the attraction of the nucleus.

**Molecules**
- When elements combined with other elements (or themselves) they become molecules (compounds)
- How elements combine changes the properties of the chemical

**Physics Terms**
- Force
- Velocity
- Acceleration
- Mass
- Volume
- Density
And Newton's laws of motion n shit
