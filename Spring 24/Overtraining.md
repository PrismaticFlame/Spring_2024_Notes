It seems there might be a slight confusion in terminology. Typically, the terms "overtraining" and "overfitting" are used interchangeably, both referring to a situation where a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and patterns specific to the training set but not generalizing well to new, unseen data. 

If by "overtraining" you mean overfitting, I'll provide information on how to avoid overfitting. If you have a specific context or definition for "overtraining" that is different from overfitting, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help accordingly.

### Overfitting (Overtraining) and How to Avoid It:

**Definition:**
Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex relative to the information content of the training data. As a result, the model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and specific patterns that don't generalize well.

**How to Avoid Overfitting:**

1. **Regularization:**
   - **L1 and L2 Regularization:** Introduce penalties on the model's parameters to prevent them from becoming too large.
   - **Elastic Net Regularization:** Combines L1 and L2 regularization.

2. **[[Cross-Validation]]:**
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Use the validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and make decisions like early stopping.

3. **Early Stopping:**
   - Monitor the model's performance on the validation set during training.
   - Stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

4. **Pruning (Decision Trees):**
   - For decision tree-based models, prune the tree to remove branches that do not contribute significantly to improving performance.

5. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - Use ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees.
   - Combining predictions from multiple models can reduce overfitting.

6. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Introduce variations in the training data by applying transformations such as rotations, flips, or zooms.

7. **Feature Selection:**
   - Select relevant features and discard irrelevant ones.
   - Use techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance from tree-based models.

8. **Simpler Models:**
   - Reduce the complexity of the model architecture.
   - Consider using simpler algorithms if the dataset is not large enough to support a complex model.

9. **Dropout (Neural Networks):**
   - Apply dropout during training in neural networks.
   - Randomly drop neurons during each iteration to prevent co-adaptation of hidden units.

10. **Regularized Loss Functions:**
    - Use loss functions with regularization terms.
    - Weighted loss functions can also be applied to assign different penalties to different samples.

11. **Cross-Domain Generalization:**
    - If applicable, consider techniques like domain adaptation when dealing with datasets from different distributions.

12. **[[Hyperparameter]] Tuning:**
    - Carefully tune hyperparameters, including those related to model complexity.
    - Use techniques like grid search or random search.

13. **Model Interpretability:**
    - Prefer models that are more interpretable and easier to understand.
    - Interpretability aids in diagnosing and mitigating overfitting.

14. **Monitoring Learning Curves:**
    - Plot learning curves to visualize the performance on the training and validation sets over epochs.

15. **Use of Validation Metrics:**
    - Beyond accuracy, consider other metrics like precision, recall, or F1 score.
    - These metrics provide a more nuanced view of model performance.

Overfitting is a common challenge, especially when working with limited data. Effective model regularization, careful monitoring, and thoughtful feature selection can help strike a balance between model complexity and generalization.
