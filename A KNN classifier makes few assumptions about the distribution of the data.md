The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric method that makes minimal assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. Unlike parametric models (e.g., linear regression) that assume a specific functional form for the data distribution, KNN does not make such assumptions. Instead, it relies on the proximity of data points in the feature space to make predictions. This flexibility allows KNN to adapt to various types of data distributions, making it suitable for both linear and non-linear relationships.
