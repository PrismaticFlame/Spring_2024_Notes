This statement reflects a fundamental principle in information theory, stating that the amount of information conveyed by an event or observation depends on the context and the level of surprise it brings. In the context of decision trees, this principle can be relevant in evaluating the significance of different features or splits. Features that provide more surprising or unexpected information about the target variable may be considered more informative and lead to better decision trees.
