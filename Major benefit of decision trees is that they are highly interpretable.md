Decision trees are inherently interpretable because they mimic human decision-making processes by splitting data into smaller subsets based on the feature values. Each node in a decision tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each branch represents a possible outcome. This transparency makes it easy for humans to understand and interpret the logic behind the decision-making process.
